## Todo App Instructions

As a potential employee of Broadnet we would like to be able to gauge your programming skill and how you approach a development task.

##### What We Expect

* Your todo app must have a PHP server-side component.
* The frontend portion of your app is entirely freeform.
* If you use a database to store app data, it must be MySQL and you must provide a SQL script to create the schema as part of your pull request.
* Your app must support creating, reading, updating, and deleting of todo list items.

##### Tips

* Quality over quantity!
* Do what you do everyday, we want to see you're development style.
* Feel free to think outside the box!

##### What to Do When You Are Done

* Assuming you forked the repository, send us a pull request.
* Alternatively, zip up your submission and email us.
